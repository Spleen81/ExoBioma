## 🌌 Abstract: The Paradigm Shift
The search for life in the universe has traditionally focused on "habitability"—a binary state largely defined by the presence of liquid water and equilibrium temperatures ($T_{eq}$). **The Exobioma Project** aims to transcend this definition. 

We propose that an exoplanetary atmosphere should not be viewed merely as a gas envelope, but as a potential **planetary biome**. By integrating terrestrial extremophile biology, atmospheric chemistry simulations, and topological analysis of Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs), we aim to model how life acts as a global pressure that reshapes its environment.

> **Core Philosophy:** "Life is not just something that happens *on* a planet; it is a thermodynamic process that happens *to* a planet."

## 🔭 Scientific Objectives
This repository will serve as the central data lake and documentation hub for the Exobioma roadmap. Our research is driven by three fundamental questions:

1.  **Beyond The Goldilocks Zone:** Can we quantify the "biological capacity" of an atmosphere using strictly measured extremophilic tolerances rather than Earth-centric assumptions?
2.  **The Ecological Imprint:** How does a microbial biosphere modify the chemical complexity of an atmosphere over geological timescales?
3.  **Observational Reality:** Can we link high-complexity indices in atmospheric networks to specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detectable by **JWST** and **ARIEL**?

## 🗺️ The Roadmap (2025-2030)

The Exobioma Project is structured into five distinct developmental phases.

### Phase 1: Beyond Habitability (Current Status: *In Publication*)
* **Goal:** Introduction of the **MLS (Multiparametric Life Score)** paradigm.
* **Method:** Mapping terrestrial extremophile limits (Temperature, Pressure, UV/X-Ray flux) onto simulated exoplanetary atmospheric layers.
* **Output:** Creation of "Atmospheric Tomography" maps identifying viable ecological niches in vertical atmospheric columns.
* **Codebase:** See our companion repository for the MLS calculation engine and visualization tools.

### Phase 2: Alien Biochemistries (2025-2026)
* **Goal:** Building `MLS 2.0`.
* **Focus:** Expanding the database beyond terrestrial analogs. Integrating theoretical biochemistries and metabolic pathways suitable for non-standard environments (e.g., high-pressure ice, hydrocarbon lakes).

### Phase 3: Modeling ExoBiomes (2026-2027)
* **Goal:** Simulating atmospheric impacts.
* **Focus:** Moving from static "suitability" to dynamic interaction. Using kinetic modeling to simulate how a thriving biomass impacts atmospheric composition (consumption of substrates, release of byproducts).

### Phase 4: Decoding Life (2027-2028)
* **Goal:** Linking MLS to Biosignatures.
* **Focus:** Application of Network Theory to chemical reaction pathways. Identifying "topological anomalies" in atmospheric CRNs that betray the presence of non-equilibrium biological drivers.

### Phase 5: The Smoking Gun (2029-2030)
* **Goal:** Observational Validation.
* **Focus:** Direct comparison of Exobioma model predictions with high-resolution spectroscopic data from the ARIEL mission and future HWO concepts.

## 🧬 Why This Matters Now?
We stand at a unique intersection in history. We have the biological data (from decades of microbiology and extremophile research) and, for the first time, the observational power (JWST, ARIEL) to test our hypotheses. 

However, **data without a framework is noise.** The Exobioma Project seeks to build the theoretical scaffold that allows us to interpret the spectral signals of the coming decade.
